I. Introduction
Create a project with available technology.
For a solid ‘sink yur teeth in’ architecture plan look at wood_chuck.png


The initial project should remain flexible – so could be used to kick off a variety of projects.
Steps should be repeatable.

The current plan is to create a follow-on project that the public can view (WoodChuck).
Then add on the ability to buy and sell (WoodHawk) – will require login  when buying and selling – no login for just viewing

The scaffold project will be as shown in the wood_chuck.png diagram.

II. Scaffolding Subprojects
    • UI (vue3)
    • Gateway Spring boot, security
    • Keycloak (OAuth2 – authentication and authorization)
    • Backend (as required – what is the best approach for each situation?)
    • Kafka (for inter-communication)



III. WoodChuck

III.a UI
Add keycloak.js

Need field to contain location on file system where photos are located.
